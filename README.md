# Seattle-Bike-Share

This data comes from Seattle's Pronto Cycle Share system, which consists of 500 bikes and 54 stations located throughout the city. There are 3 datasets that provide data on the stations, trips, and weather from 2014-2016. This analysis focuses on the trips dataset, and looks at the number and duration of trips in 2015 in order to better predict bike stocking needs throughout the year.

From this analysis, we can see that while people take more rides in March, April and July, their rides last longest in May, June, and July. Therefore, if people are using the bikes more frequently and for longer periods of time in July, then it is possible that bike docking stations would be emptier in that month, and may need more frequent restocking.
